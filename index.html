        <h2>Download</h2>

<p>Binaries of Charl are available at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/charl">sourceforge</a>.</p>

<h2>Install [From Source]</h2>

<p>Charl can be built on many Linux distros, Windows, and OSX. It has three
dependencies to resolve first though. These are enet, sodium, and gtk2.</p>

<p>To set up on *buntu distros</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install libenet-dev libgtk2.0-dev
wget http://download.dnscrypt.org/libsodium/releases/libsodium-0.4.tar.gz
cd libsodium-0.4
./configure
make
sudo make install
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/PaytonTurnage/Charl.git
cd Charl
sh unix.sh
</code></pre>

<p>On Windows, you'll need to install Cygwin or Msys with pkg-config, gtk2, and
manually build and install sodium and enet. When that's done, just run</p>

<pre><code>sh win.sh
</code></pre>

<p>in Msys or Cygwin or the like.</p>

<p>On OSX you will also have to manually get sodium and enet and build/install them
with the configure ritual, and for gtk2 I reccomend using MacPorts or Homebrew.
Use the unix script for OSX as well.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/PaytonTurnage/Charl3/wiki">Charl wiki</a> on github has manuals for both the client side and server side.</p>

<h2>Warning</h2>

<p>To avoid any confusion about what Charl is: this is a high school independent
study project. I am not a crypto expert by any means; this is a project I'm
using to learn how to cryptosystems. I plan to continue building on it and
making it better for a long while into the future, but as of now, the only thing
I can gauruntee for it as far as security is: better than Yahoo! Messenger. That
said, the crypto is provided by sodium and NaCl, the authors of which <strong>are</strong> crypto
experts.</p>

<h2>Contribution</h2>

<p>If you happen to use Charl, please take a moment to tell me how you felt about
it, good or bad. As the developer it's hard for me to evaluate it from a
usability point of view, so feedback is welcome! Just email me at 
<a href="mailto:paytonturnage@gmail.com">paytonturnage@gmail.com</a>.</p>

<p>Similarly, if you've got a patch you want to contribute, email me the git diff
or submit a pullrequest to github. You'll be credited and I'll give you a
complement!</p>
