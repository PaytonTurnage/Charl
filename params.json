{"name":"Charl","tagline":"A simple and secure chat system.","body":"Download\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nBinaries of Charl are available at [sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/charl).\r\n\r\nInstall [From Source]\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nCharl can be built on many Linux distros, Windows, and OSX. It has three\r\ndependencies to resolve first though. These are enet, sodium, and gtk2.\r\n\r\nTo set up on *buntu distros\r\n\r\n    sudo apt-get install libenet-dev libgtk2.0-dev\r\n    wget http://download.dnscrypt.org/libsodium/releases/libsodium-0.4.tar.gz\r\n    tar -xzvf libsodium-0.4.tar.gz\r\n    cd libsodium-0.4\r\n    ./configure\r\n    make\r\n    sudo make install\r\n    cd ..\r\n    git clone https://github.com/PaytonTurnage/Charl.git\r\n    cd Charl\r\n    sh unix.sh\r\n\r\nOn Windows, you'll need to install Cygwin or Msys with pkg-config, gtk2, and\r\nmanually build and install sodium and enet. When that's done, just run\r\n\r\n    sh win.sh\r\n\r\nin Msys or Cygwin or the like.\r\n\r\nOn OSX you will also have to manually get sodium and enet and build/install them\r\nwith the configure ritual, and for gtk2 I reccomend using MacPorts or Homebrew.\r\nUse the unix script for OSX as well.\r\n\r\n    sudo port install gtk2\r\n    wget http://download.dnscrypt.org/libsodium/releases/libsodium-0.4.tar.gz\r\n    tar -xzvf libsodium-0.4.tar.gz\r\n    cd libsodium-0.4\r\n    ./configure\r\n    make\r\n    sudo make install\r\n    wget http://enet.bespin.org/download/enet-1.3.7.tar.gz\r\n    tar -xzvf enet-1.3.7.tar.gz\r\n    cd enet-1.3.7\r\n    ./configure\r\n    make\r\n    sudo make install\r\n    git clone https://github.com/PaytonTurnage/Charl.git\r\n    cd Charl\r\n    sh unix.sh\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nThe [Charl wiki](https://github.com/PaytonTurnage/Charl3/wiki) on github has manuals for both the client side and server side.\r\n\r\nWarning\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTo avoid any confusion about what Charl is: this is a high school independent\r\nstudy project. I am not a crypto expert by any means; this is a project I'm\r\nusing to learn how to cryptosystems. I plan to continue building on it and\r\nmaking it better for a long while into the future, but as of now, the only thing\r\nI can gauruntee for it as far as security is: better than Yahoo! Messenger. That\r\nsaid, the crypto is provided by sodium and NaCl, the authors of which **are** crypto\r\nexperts.\r\n\r\nContribution\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nIf you happen to use Charl, please take a moment to tell me how you felt about\r\nit, good or bad. As the developer it's hard for me to evaluate it from a\r\nusability point of view, so feedback is welcome! Just email me at \r\npaytonturnage@gmail.com.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, if you've got a patch you want to contribute, email me the git diff\r\nor submit a pullrequest to github. You'll be credited and I'll give you a\r\ncomplement!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
